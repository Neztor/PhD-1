In the first step of simulating the muons in the SiD detector, event displays were made with WIRED4\cite{Wired4}.
The xy- and zy-views of these event displays can be seen for both shielding scenarios in Figure~\ref{fig:WIRED4}.
The event displays show the hits in the SiD detector for one ILC bunch train which consist of 1312 bunches.
The time structure of the ILC bunch trains is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Beam_TimeStructure}.
First of all, without the magnetized wall as a last shielding mechanism about six times more muons enter the interaction region.
In these plots, as in all following, the shown distributions are from muons from one ILC bunch train, since the SiD sensor buffers will be read out after every train only.\\
Second, the muons travel through the detector horizontally which could be taken advantage of for the alignment of the subdetectors.
The spatial distributions of the muons in both scenarios are shifted towards the top and the left.
The reason for the top-bottom and left-right asymmetry is the shielding ability of the tunnel walls and floor.
Since the detector hall is set into the floor, and the BDS system is curved, only the muons being emitted in such a way that they get through the tunnel opening to the detector hall hit the detector.
Finally, the most significant difference between the two scenarios is the broad spatial distribution for the scenario with the wall in comparison to the distinct distribution in the ``5 Spoilers'' scenario.
The magnetized wall deflects the muons and also stops the low energy ones, so that the muon rate is reduced and the muons are additionally distributed over the whole detector area.
Figure~\ref{fig:muon_energy} shows the muon energy distributions for both shielding scenarios.

    Event displays in the xy- and zy-view of the muons from the ``5 Spoilers + Wall'' and ``5 Spoilers'' scenario in the SiD detector.
    Figures a) and b) show hits from 515 muons with the magnetized wall, and c) and d) show hits from 2961 muons without the wall.
    The number of muons corresponds to the number of muons accumulated over one ILC bunch train (1312 bunch crossings), but in both cases the muons come from the positron line of the BDS only.
    Hence, one has to imagine roughly double the amount of hits in the SiD detector to get the full picture of all hits from muons from one bunch train.

    The peak for low energies is therefore missing in the second scenario, and the whole distribution is shifted towards lower energies.

The difference in the spatial distributions explains the different numbers of hits in the single subdetectors for the two scenarios, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hit_distribution}.
With the muon endcaps having the largest effective detector area, the number of hits is the highest in this subdetector.
Table~\ref{tab:KeyParametersSiD} lists the different components of the SiD detector with their physical sizes, the technology used, and the sizes of the readout cells.

    The two scenarios are colored in red (``5 Spoilers'') and blue (``5 Spoilers + Wall'') as before.
    The number of hits is proportional to the effective detector area.
    Since the muons travel horizontally through the detector from one side to the other, the detector with the biggest effective area perpendicular to the muon incidence has the highest number of hits.

Cells are declared ``dead'' when they are hit by more tracks than the buffer depth allows, as any hits beyond the buffer depth limit can not be recorded.
Figure~\ref{fig:Occupancy_DeadCells} shows the occupancy plots and the number of dead cells resulting from the occupancy for both scenarios, and for two different subdetectors: the tracker endcaps and the ECAL endcaps. 
The occupancy in the tracker endcaps (Figure~\ref{fig:SiTracker_Occupancy}) is very low for both scenarios.
Only 10\textsuperscript{-9} - 10\textsuperscript{-7} of all cells get four hits.
The resulting number of dead cells in the tracker endcaps (Figure~\ref{fig:SiTracker_DeadCells}) shows that for a buffer depth of four only 10\textsuperscript{-8} of all cells get four or more hits and therefore reach the buffer limit in the ``5 Spoilers + Wall''.
The ``5 Spoilers'' case would do only one order of magnitude better.\\
But the muon background yields a much higher occupancy in the ECAL endcaps which is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:Ecal_Occupancy} and \ref{fig:Ecal_DeadCells}.
The reason for the occupancy being higher than in the tracker endcaps for both cases is simply due to the bigger effective detector area as explained before.
Despite that and the fact that the ``5 Spoilers + Wall'' case is better by an order of magnitude (when looking at a buffer depth of four), the occupancy is still at a level of only about 10\textsuperscript{-6} - 10\textsuperscript{-5}.
The interesting fact is that the ``5 Spoilers'' case shows up to 27 hits per cell with a roughly constant occupancy for all buffer depths.
This leads to dead cell distributions which are vastly different.
For an assumed buffer depth of four, the total number of dead cells is different by about two orders of magnitude when comparing the two shielding scenarios.
In the ``5 Spoilers'' case, 10\textsuperscript{-4} - 10\textsuperscript{-3} cells would have reached the buffer limit regardless of which buffer depth was chosen for the sensor design.
The cause of this distribution is the spatial distribution of the muons in the ``5 Spoilers'' case: there are many more muons hitting the detector, and additionally all concentrated on a small area of the detector.

    \caption[Muon occupancy in the tracker endcaps and ECAL endcaps]{
    Figures ~\ref{fig:SiTracker_Occupancy} and \ref{fig:Ecal_Occupancy} show for both shielding scenarios the muon occupancy in the tracker endcaps and the ECAL endcaps, i.e. the fraction of all cells that are hit a certain number of times.
    The plots are normalized by the total number of cells in this subdetector.\\
    Figures~\ref{fig:SiTracker_DeadCells} and \ref{fig:Ecal_DeadCells} show in comparison the number of dead cells which is the result of the occupancy and the buffer depth of the sensors.
    For a given buffer depth, all cells with hit numbers greater or equal than the buffer depth are ``dead'', and therefore blind to all following hits.
    Therefore, in the hypothetical case of a buffer depth of 0, all cells are dead.\\
    In all plots, the green dashed line represents the buffer depth of the current sensor design.

Finally, also the timing of the muons with respect to the bunch crossing was studied.
All of the muons from the BDS are created up to \unit{0.5}\,{ns} after the bunch passing the material, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Creation_time}.
Although the muons are created instantaneously, it takes a long time for them to hit certain subdetectors, such as the inner lying ECAL.
The muons have to travel through the outer subdetectors before they reach the ECAL endcaps, which takes about \unit{20}\,{ns}.
After roughly another \unit{20}\,{ns} the second endcap has been reached, so that hits in the ECAL endcaps can be registered several tens of nanoseconds after the bunch crossing .
The muons also produce shower particles when passing through the whole detector material.
The low energy shower particles then hit the ECAL endcaps even later than the primary muons.
