%% Text of abstract
To suppress the muon background arising from the Beam Delivery System (BDS) of the International Linear Collider (ILC), and to hinder it from reaching the interaction region, two different shielding scenarios are under discussion: five cylindrical muon spoilers with or without an additional magnetized shielding wall.
Due to cost and safety issues, the case preferred by the MDI group is to omit the shielding wall, which on the other hand brings other disadvantages.
To support the decision making, the impact of the muons from the two different shielding scenarios was studied in a full Geant4 detector simulation of the SiD detector, one of two proposed detectors for the ILC. 
Input to this study is the muon background created by the beam traveling through the BDS, which was simulated with the simulation tool MUCARLO.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The muon background from the BDS arises from the the beam halo hitting the material along the beam line, e.g. the beam collimator systems.
Therefore, the muons are created along the BDS and travel towards the interaction region.
To prevent the muons from reaching the detectors, it is studied which shielding system would be effective and reasonable to be integrated in the BDS.
Several different shielding scenarios have already been under discussion and have been dropped, so that the two cases currently discussed and presented in this proceeding are both yielding acceptable muon rates at the interaction region.
In the first scenario five cylindrical magnetized spoilers are installed at different positions along the beam line.
The second scenario adds a magnetized iron wall close to the interaction region.
Both, the spoilers and the wall are shown in schematic drawings in Figure~\ref{fig:Spoilers_Wall}.
Their location in the BDS can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Spoilers_Wall_Locations}.

    \caption[BDS tunnel with the spoiler and wall positions]{
    The five spoilers are located at the following positions along the BDS tunnel: \unit{802.5}{m}, \unit{975.5}{m}, \unit{1145.5}{m}, \unit{1234.5}{m}, and \unit{1358.5}{m}.
    For the second shielding scenario, the wall would be additionally installed at \unit{400}{m} away from the interaction point.
    }
    \label{fig:Spoilers_Wall_Locations}
\end{figure}

Due to the size of the wall which causes cost and safety issues, the MDI group prefers the first scenario without the wall.
What has to be kept in mind on the other hand is that the wall reduces not only the muon rate but also shields the neutron and photon background created by the machine.
Not having this shielding wall would therefore mean no access to the interaction region when the beam is on, i.e. the access to the detector in the garage position will not be allowed.
