\section{Summary and conclusion}
By looking at the luminosity spectra generated for this study, the expected increase in luminosity for the new ILC250 parameter sets could be confirmed.
The background studies indicate that the new official beam parameter set (A) increases the \Pep\Pem pair background density and the SiD vertex detector occupancy by only a factor of about 2-3 in comparison to the original TDR beam parameters.
Although the density of the pair background close to the interaction point rises, the normalized vertex detector occupancy for the new set is well below 10$^{-4}$.
The SiD Optimization group is confident that this can be accommodated in the design of the SiD vertex detector without a loss in precision for the physics studies.
