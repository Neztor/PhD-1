The test beam generation for the DESY-II test beam line was simulated with the Monte Carlo simulation software \slic. This first fully flexible simulation toolkit of the DESY-II test beam lines simulates the beam bunch of the synchrotron accelerator DESY-II, and the single test beam line components. The full simulation yields studies of the beam attributes of the final test beam, like its energy and spread, and the beam rate. The studies done with the simulation toolkit can be used as input for other Monte Carlo simulation studies, and as the key input for improvements to the DESY-II test beam lines as well as to the experimental set-up and analysis of future test beam users.
