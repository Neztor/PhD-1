\section{The DESY-II test beam simulation}
\subsection{Software used for the simulation toolkit}
The simulation of the DESY-II test beam generation was done using 
\slic~\cite{Graf:2006ei,slic}, a full simulation package that uses the \geant \cite{Agostinelli2003250,1610988} detector 
simulation toolkit. As mentioned previously, the test beam generation involves  
several steps, each of which involves certain beam line components. The 
components' geometry is defined in a \gdml (Geometry Description Markup 
Language) file, which allows the description of detector geometries with 
arbitrary placements~\cite{gdml}. A so-called compact \xml file, to which the 
\gdml file is linked, contains additional information about the world volume, 
tracking volume and other self defined logical volumes. Magnetic fields and 
various kinds of sensitive detector parts, which can be set up to simulate 
particle detectors, are specified in the compact file as well. 
The \xml compact file and the \gdml file are then compiled into the  \lcdd~(``Linear Collider Detector Description)~\cite{McCormick:2005jc} file format, as \geant requires all 
information about the geometry, the fields and sensitive detector parts sorted 
by the solid, the physical volume and the logical volume. The conversion using 
the \textit{detector-framework} software package from the \lcsim (Linear Collider 
Simulation) framework expands the basic information of the detector components 
into the verbose and hierarchical style that is required for \geant. \\ \slic's 
stores the output of the simulation using th  \lcio (Linear Collider 
Input/Output) format~\cite{Aplin:2012kj,LCIO_DOC}.

\subsection{Event generation for DESY-II beam bunch}
The first step in the chain of the test beam generation is the DESY-II beam 
bunch consisting of 10$^{10}$ electrons or positrons hitting a primary target 
placed directly in the beam pipe. 
Thi uses the  average properties of a  DESY-II bunch, like the beam bunch size 
and its energy distribution.
\slic uses the \geant physics list \textit{LCPhys}~\cite{SLIC_LCPhys} 
, which contains several classes for gamma, lepton, hadron and 
ion physics as well as particle decays.

The energy and spatial distribution of the simulated DESY-II synchrotron beam is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DESY-II_beam_bunch_energy_spacial_deflection}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The test beam primary target}

The primary target of the DESY-II test beam lines is a carbon fibre of 25(NOTE, 
actually more like 6-7) \,\textmu m thickness. When the simulated DESY-II beam 
bunch hits the fibre, bremsstrahlung photons are emitted, their energy 
distribution which follows the characteristic $\frac{1}{E}$ dependency 
of bremsstrahlung spectra is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bremsstrahlung_spectrum}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Photons_after_Fibre_bigger_world_large.eps}
  \caption[Simulated bremsstrahlung photons emitted from the primary target.]{The DESY-II beam bunch hits the primary target and emits bremsstrahlung photons. The carbon fibre as well as the dimensions and shape of the beam bunch are clearly visible.}
  \label{fig:bremsstrahlung_scatter}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bremsstrahlungSpectrum_wo_Chi2.eps}
  \caption[Simulated bremsstrahlung spectrum emitted from the primary target.]{The DESY-II beam bunch of 10$^{10}$ electrons generates in total about $2\cdot10^5$ bremsstrahlung photons by hitting the primary target. The bremsstrahlung spectrum reaches to about 6.3\,GeV, which is the maximum energy of the photons, as they cannot exceed the maximum energy of the respective electrons. Mostly low energy photons in the MeV range are produced.}
  \label{fig:bremsstrahlung_spectrum}
\end{figure}

% The number of emitted photons in a certain energy range, between $k_{min}$ and $k_{max}$, can be expressed with the following equation for the case of a very thin target ($dt\rightarrow d\ll X_0$) \cite[page 405]{PDG}:
% \begin{equation}
%  N_{\gamma}=\frac{d}{X_0}\left[\frac43ln\left(\frac{k_{max}}{k_{min}}\right)-\frac{4(k_{max}-k_{min})}{3E}+\frac{k_{max}^2-k_{min}^2}{2E^2}\right]
%  \label{eq:bremsstrahlung_spectrum_2}
% \end{equation}

 
As the bremsstrahlung photons can only exit the beam pipe tangentially to DESY-II 
synchrotron ring, the further test beam line components are placed along the 
beam path of the bremsstrahlung photons. A map of the DESY-II test beam facility with its three test beam lines are 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Test Beam Lines}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The secondary target}
{\bfseries{Coordinate System ????}}
In the secondary target, the bremsstrahlung photons are converted to electron/positron pairs.  As the cross section for pair production is dependent on material and target thickness, the rate of the final test beam depends on the choice of the secondary target. The test beam users can choose from a set different converter plates cosnisting of aluminium and copper of various thicknesses.. The most commonly used converter target is the a copper target with 5\,mm thickness as it yields the highest particle rate.

Figure~\ref{fig:converter_rates} shows the comparison between the numbers of electrons and positrons simulated after the conversion of 205,500 photons in the different converters. Copper targets yield higher electron rates than the aluminium targets, and the thicker the material, the more photons are converted into electron/positron pairs. The copper wire yields the least electron/positron pairs. From the plotted numbers, the approximate conversion efficiencies were calculated and listed in Table~\ref{table:conversion_efficiency}.

  \label{table:conversion_efficiency}
\end{table}

\subsection{The test beam magnet}

The magnets used in the team lines are bending dipole magnets (For details 
see~\cite{DESY_TB_magnet_MR}). 
The electron/positron pairs converted from the bremsstrahlung photons in the 
secondary target enter the test beam magnet through an evacuated beam pipe, 
about 60\,cm behind the converter plate. The simulated geometry is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:3D_model_converter}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{3D_simulation_model_converter_particles.eps}
  \caption[3D simulation model of a converter plate in front of the dipole magnet.]{The simulated converter plate in front of the dipole magnet of the test beam line. Schematically, an electron and positron are shown  entering the dipole bending magnet and bent in opposite direction in the xz-plane.}
    \label{fig:3D_model_converter}
\end{figure}

The electron/positron beam is spread by the dipole into a particle fan in the xz-plane 
and separated by charge and energy. Neutral particles, like unconverted photons, 
 are not deflected in a magnetic field and stay on their 
initial path (in the case they are not scattered or stopped), they will leave 
the test beam magnet centrally through the exit beam pipe.\\
To separate the neutral particles from the desired electrons and positrons of 
the final test beam, the beam pipe has a small kink 15\,cm behind the test beam 
magnet. The kink angle of the pipe is 32\,mrad about the y-axis, in the positive 
x-direction. All subsequent components of the test beam line are positioned 
along this new beam path. Only charged particles with the desired momentum continue 
along the new beam path, whereas all other particles will not enter the 
subsequent beam line components. 
The particle energy can controlled by test beam user by adjusting the current of the dipole magnet.

Since the beam pipe has a radius of 5\,cm and is kinked, only the previously selected part of 
the fan enters the test beam area. The particle mometum is Gaussian distributed, where the mean 
value belongs to the particles following the ideal beam path through the centre 
of the pipe. The width of the distribution is large due to the large beam pipe aperture.
The beam size and therefore the width of the energy distribution can be reduced by two independent collimator systems, 
which can be controlled by the test beam users.
 
To illustrate the deflection of charged particles in the test beam magnet, 
Figures~\ref{fig:deflection_plot_neg/pos} show the deflection of the particles a
x-y-plane of behind the dipole magnet. The two 
separate particle fans for positively and negatively charged particles are 
clearly visible. The black circle indicate the contour of the beam pipe and only particles within
enter the beam pipe behind the magnet. The other particles will hit 
the iron surrounding of the magnet and not proceed along the beam path. Since the 
beam pipe is kinked in positive y-direction (see above), only the 
particles that are also deflected in the positive x-direction ({\bfseries x oder y} are able to 
continue on the test beam line. If the users desire positrons instead of electrons  the magnetic field 
polarity has to be reversed.

 \caption[Position plots for negatively/positively charged particles behind the test beam magnet.]{The points represent the x-/y-positions of the particles directly behind the magnet, e.g. the positions where the particles leave the magnet. The black circle illustrates the beam pipe coming out of the magnet. For the simulation, a magnetic field strength of B\,=\,-0.3\,T was chosen. The particles around the particle fan (particles with 0\,mm\,<\,x\,<\,400\,mm in Figure (a), and -400\,mm\,<\,x\,<0\,mm in Figure (b)) are scattered particles. This deviating from the particle fan is caused by particles entering the magnet with an angle to the z-axis or scattering off the material in the magnet or both.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{The primary test beam collimator}

The test beam collimator consists of two separate collimators, a horizontal and 
vertical one. They are both built up by two tungsten blocks with variable 
distance between each other. By collimating the beam, the Gaussian energy 
distribution of the final test beam is narrowed, and the stronger the 
collimation, the smaller is the width of the distribution.\\
Figure~\ref{fig:3D_model_collimators} shows the visualised simulated model of 
the collimator with a gap size of 1\,cm, which is most commonly used.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{3D_simulation_model_collimators.eps}
  \caption[3D simulation model of the horizontal and vertical collimators of the test beam lines.]{The simulated model of the horizontal and vertical collimators of the test beam lines are visualised with a \vrml viewer. The gap size between the tungsten blocks of both of the collimators is 1\,cm. The distance between the horizontal and the vertical collimator is about 7.9\,cm.}
    \label{fig:3D_model_collimators}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Final collimation in the test beam area}

The test beam areas are separated from the DESY-II synchrotron tunnel by a 
concrete wall, that is up to 5\,m thick. The concrete is radiation safety 
concrete with a fraction of 90\,\% iron. After the first collimation by the 
horizontal and vertical collimators, the beam continues along the evacuated beam 
pipe through the concrete wall into the test beam area. 
To illustrate the trajectory of a beam particle, the simulation of a geantino 
trajectory in the test beam line is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TBline_trajectory}. 
A geantino is a virtual particle for transportation processes in \geant 
simulations.~\cite{Geantino}
\\In the test beam area, the test beam is again collimated by a lead collimator 
with different available hole sizes. The size of the collimator hole affects 
amongst others the number of particles and the width of the energy distribution 
of the final test beam.
