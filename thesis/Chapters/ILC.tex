\chapter{The International Linear Collider}
\label{ILC}
The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a linear \electron \positron accelerator with an center-of-mass energy of \SI{500}{\GeV} in the first stage and \SI{1}{\TeV} in the second.
The state of the art technologies for both, the detectors and the machine, and the machine design make a clean environment and high precision measurements possible, because of which the ILC will be a unique machine.\\
The following sections will talk about the ILC layout, its possible sites, the two detectors, and finally the physics motivation for such a capable accelerator.

\section{Motivating the layout}
\label{ILC:layout}

\subsection{The Layout}
Figure~\ref{fig:ILC_Layout} shows the schematic layout of the ILC for the \SI{500}{\GeV} stage.

The electrons originate in the polarized source based on a photocathode DC gun.
When these electrons pass through an undulator, high-energy photons are produced which are then converted to electron-positron pairs.
The polarized positrons from these pairs continue in the positron line which is from that point on equivalent to the electron line.
After passing the \SI{5}{\GeV} Damping Rings (DR) with a circumference of \SI{3.2}{\kilo\meter}, the electron and positron beams are compressed into bunches by a two-stage compressor system.
Subsequent to that, the bunches are injected into the main linacs.
The main linacs have a length of \SI{11}{\kilo\meter}, and use superconducting radio frequency (RF) cavities with a frequency of \SI{1.3}{\giga\hertz} and an average accelerating gradient of \SI{31.5}{MV/m}.
For the machine upgrade to \SI{1}{\TeV}, the linacs can be extended in length.
The Beam Delivery System (BDS), which has an overall length of about \SI{4.4}{\kilo\meter}, transports the bunches from the linacs to the Interaction Point (IP).
In the BDS, the beams are focused to nanometer size by the Final Focus (FF) system.
After that, the beams are then finally brought into collision with a crossing angle of \SI{14}{mrad} at the IP.\cite[p. 9-10]{TDR1}
Table~\ref{tab:ILC_parameters} shows the machine parameters for the baseline design at \SI{500}{\GeV} center-of-mass energy, and for the luminosity and the energy upgrade stages.

The Interaction Region (IR) houses the two detectors for the ILC, the Silicon Detector (SiD) and the International Large Detector (ILD), which are in a push-pull system.
The detectors and the push-pull system are explained in more detail in Section~\ref{ILC:detectors}.

\subsection{Physics Motivation}
\label{ILC:physicsmotivation}

The ILC can be motivated in different ways.
First, the advantages it will have over hadron colliders can be summarized with only four key words.
Second, the ILC will be a Higgs factory which will measure the qualities of the Higgs boson with much higher precision than it had been done so far.
Additionally, the ILC will not only be a Higgs factory but will also measure the Top quark qualities, and will have access to Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics.\\
The following paragraphs will go into more detail about the first two points and will motivate on the basis of these points why the ILC is a great machine.

\subsubsection{Key words}
The physics motivation for the ILC can be summarized with four key words: Cleanliness, Democracy, Calculability and Detail.\cite[p. 2-5]{TDR2}
In the following, the meaning of these key words will be explained with respect to the great advantages the ILC has in comparison to hadron colliders, like the LHC.
\paragraph{Cleanliness}
Cleanliness describes the clean events the detectors at the ILC will record.
The environment is clean because of the small background levels and therefore small detector occupancy in comparison to a hadron collider.
Due to the polarization of both beams, there are only events with couplings to electroweak interactions, which reduces the background level.
The energy range is restricted, since the initial energy of the colliding beams can be set precisely and only point-like particles collide.
Therefore, there are no underlying events which arise from the other nuclei of the composite particle, like in a proton-proton collider.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Cleanliness.png}
\caption[Clean environment at the ILC]{Comparison of the event displays of a Higgs event at the  LHC and at the ILC.\cite[p. 4]{ILCPhysics_Thomson}\\
The comparison shows that at the ILC the hits recorded are exclusively from the final state particles of the physics interaction.
At the LHC, underlying and pileup events populate the detector.}
\label{fig:Cleanliness}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Democracy}
Because the elementary coupling e of photons is the same for all quarks and leptons, the \electron \positron annihilation produces pairs of all species, from the Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model, at similar rates.
Besides that, the ILC will be taking data without triggers, i.e. all events will be recorded.
This is possible because of the Cleanliness.
\paragraph{Calculability}
The energies involved in the initial states are precisely known, since there are only point-like elementary particles in initial state.
There are only events with couplings to electroweak interactions.
Additionally, systematic uncertainties due to PDF uncertainties and QCD corrections are omitted.
\paragraph{Detail}
Because of the clean events and the possibility to record and store all taken data, events can be reconstructed in completeness without theoretical assumptions.
The quark and lepton momenta can therefore be determined by kinematic fits.
Studies of the spin-dependence of the production and decay processes are also possible.\\
Due to the high energy resolution and the fact that the initial particle energies are precisely known, particles with small mass differences are distinguishable, i.e. peaks in mass spectra that are close together are more likely to be separable.\\
Additionally, the nano-sized beam of the ILC allows the vertex detector to be close to the IP. 
Hence, c-tagging is possible at the ILC which improves a lot of physics studies.

\subsubsection{ILC as a Higgs factory}
One could call the ILC a Higgs factory, since the total cross section for Higgs production is 10\textsuperscript{-2} in comparison to 10\textsuperscript{-9} for the LHC for example.
%TODO : Find source or plot that shows the total production cross sections at ILC and LHC
Therefore, the number of Higgs events measured at the ILC will be significantly higher, namely about 10 Higgs events per hour.
Due to the large statistics and the capability for precision measurements, the individual Higgs couplings can be measured to a percent accuracy and the global width of the Higgs can be measured directly.
When taking the LHC as an example, the LHC experiments have to make a global fit to all Higgs signals and make assumptions of the Higgs width, in order to get the Higgs couplings.
This can not be as precise as at the ILC, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Higgs_couplings}.
Only for the coupling to photons, the LHC yields more precise measurements which can only be topped by the combination of the LHC and the ILC results.

\end{figure}
%TODO : Check if there is a more up-to-date picture

\section{Possible Site}
\label{ILC:site}
Out of originally 10 potential ILC sites in Japan, the Kitakami mountains in the Tohuku Prefecture was chosen to be the preferred site for the ILC.
This decision was made in July 2013 after a detailed study of all site specific factors, like the geological conditions, the infrastructure, and the impact on the environment and the economy.
As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ILC_Site}, the closest city with about 120,000 citizens would be Ichinoseki.
Morioka and Sendai are the biggest cities around the candidate site, with Tokyo being about \SI{430}{\kilo\meter} away.
Although being in the north of Japan, the travel time from Tokyo is only about three hours, and the proximity to the coast line allows the transportation of construction, machine and detector parts by ship.

\end{figure}

\section{The Experiments}
\label{ILC:detectors}

In order to preserve the competitive spirit and the ability to cross-check results, the ILC has two detectors despite the fact that it is a linear and not a circular collider.
The so-called push-pull system makes that possible by allowing the detectors to switch position after a certain amount of data-taking time.
The whole detector together with the last quadrupole magnet of the accelerator Final Focus system will be pulled out of the beam line, and the other one will be pushed in.
The whole process is designed to take only a short time, i.e. several hours up to 1-2 days, but involves some challenges especially for the magnets, the cryogenics and the detector and machine alignment.\cite[p. 28-29]{TDR1}
The two detectors, the Silicon Detector (SiD) and the International Large Detector (ILD), will be explained in detail in the following with a bigger focus on the SiD detector since some of the background studies presented in the thesis were made for the SiD only.

\subsection{The Silicon Detector}
The SiD is designed to be a robust, compact detector with the vertex and tracker subdetectors and the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) being based on silicon sensors.
The silicon design in comparison to other designs for the vertex and tracking detectors is more robust regarding the beam background and timing.
With also the highly segmented hadronic calorimeter being inside the solenoid field, particle tracking is possible even in the calorimeters.
With being designed to be compact, the measurements for the full detector are \SI{14}{m} in height and \SI{11}{m} in length.
To compensate the small radius, so that SiD is still hermetic and contains the full particle showers, the magnetic field of the superconducting solenoid magnet is \SI{5}{T}.

Figure~\ref{fig:SiD} shows schematic drawings of the SiD detector and its subdetectors.

\label{fig:SiD}
\end{figure}
%TODO : Update the picture of the SiD detector -> new design for muon system

Overall the SiD detector is optimized for Particle Flow Algorithms (PFA).
PFA is a reconstruction method that reconstructs each particle of the final state individually and uses the different subdetectors for a specific purpose.
Therefore, charged particles are reconstructed from tracks in the tracker device, the ECAL is used for photons, and the ECAL and HCAL together for other neutral particles. 
%TODO : Find a source for explanation of PFA

\subsection{The International Large Detector}

Like the SiD detector, ILD is a multi-purpose particle detector that is optimized for PFA.
Its vertex detector is also based on silicon sensors, whereas the tracker is a combination of both, a silicon strip and pixel detector and a time projection chamber (TPC).
Also similar to SiD, the calorimeters are within the solenoid magnet, which is only surrounded by the muon system.
The magnetic field of the superconducting solenoid magnet is \SI{3.5}{T} for the ILD.
Because of having a big gaseous volume, the full detector is bigger than SiD, namely \SI{16}{m} in height and \SI{14}{m} in length.
Figure~\ref{fig:ILD} shows all the subdetectors mentioned above in two schematic drawings of the ILD detector.
