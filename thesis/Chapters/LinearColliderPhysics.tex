\chapter{Accelerator Physics of Linear Colliders}
\label{LinearColliderPhysics}

\begin{chapterabstract}
Since the invention of the first particle accelerator in 1930, many new forms of accelerators were discovered and developed over the years. 
Even though they may differ in shape and form, they all rely on the same principles. 
After a brief introduction of these principles of accelerator physics, there will be a description of the two classes of particle accelerators which are mainly used for high-energy physics nowadays: linear and circular colliders. 
By looking at their advantages and disadvantages, the differences between them will be elaborated.

In 1930, J. D. Cockcroft and E. T. S. Walton constructed the first particle accelerator, in order to probe the nuclei of lithium atoms with protons accelerated to several hundred keV. 
They found that the key in particle acceleration lies in electrostatics.

\section{Principles of particle acceleration}
\label{AcceleratorPhysics}
Charged particles are accelerated inside an electric field. 
In a time independent electric field $\vec{E}$ with potential $U$, the particle with charge $q$ experiences a change in its kinetic energy by passing through this electric field.
\begin{equation}
 \Delta E = q \int \vec{E}d\vec{r} = qU
\end{equation}
The particle's charge expressed in the elementary charge e is simply multiplied by the electric potential in Volts to calculate the gain or loss of the particle's kinetic energy. 
Out of convenience, the unit for energy in particle physics is therefore eV.\\
By this logic a particle is accelerated to higher energies by applying higher and higher electrostatic fields. 
Exactly this was done in the beginning of particle accelerators by increasing the voltage applied to a capacitor and shooting the charged particle through. 
Unfortunately, there are limits to the amount of voltage that can be applied before an electric breakdown.
The solution seems simple: putting several capacitors in a row.
But again, this can not be done with electrostatic capacitors since the field gradient between two different capacitors is directed in the opposite direction.
A particle traveling from one capacitor to the next would then lose kinetic energy again.
A solution is quickly found by using time dependent electric fields.\\
In very simple terms, the key principles of a linear collider are thereby already explained.
Better accelerating structures, such as drift chambers and later on superconducting radio frequency (RF) cavities, were developed over the years.
The first linear accelerator using normal conducting drift chambers of increasing lengths was built by Rolf Wider\o e at the university of Karlsruhe in Germany.
Nowadays, particle accelerators all over the world mainly use the superconducting RF cavities since the electric resistance is minimal due to their superconducting nature.

Rolf Wider\o e did not only build the first linear accelerator, he much more invented the principles of the betatron, the very first accelerating structure using electromagnetic fields.
Also the cyclotron which was invented in 1928 uses a magnetic field to deflect the charged particles on a radial path, and therefore allow the accelerating structure to be much smaller than a linear accelerator.
Exactly that idea was needed to advance particle acceleration from linear to circular.

\section{Linear colliders in comparison to circular colliders}
\label{Linear-Circular}

Circular acceleration does also have certain challenges.
Since the particle gains energy over time its the radius of its circular path increases if the magnetic field is constant.
The accelerator has to be built accordingly taking the increase in the radius into account, or needs to use magnets with their field strengths increasing over time.
Ladder is done in modern circular accelerators, like synchrotron accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Switzerland.
The reason why large synchrotron rings need pre-accelerators is that the range for changing the magnet's field strength is limited.
