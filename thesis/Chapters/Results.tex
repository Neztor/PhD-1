\chapter{Prospects, Requirements and Limits for a Future Linear Collider}
\label{Results}

As chapter~\ref{EffectDetectors} has shown, the background sources of a linear collider are dependent on the certain factors, like the beam orbit and the machine parameters.
These dependencies result in requirements and limits that can be formulated for the International Linear Collider.
